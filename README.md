# Image-Slider
This project is a simple and interactive Image Slider created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays multiple images one after another like a slideshow. The user can manually navigate through the images using the "Next" and "Previous" buttons, and the slider also automatically changes the image every few seconds.
